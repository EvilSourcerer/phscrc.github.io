description: At our school, we have letter days which determine whether or not you have a lab day, but it is always difficult to remember what day it is. The letter days are between A and G, which coincidentally is the largest number that can be represented in 3 bits. Lachlan found a toy traffic light which just randomly cycled throught the three colors. He decided to hack it to show the letter day. We installed a raspberry pi inside the traffic light and wrote a script that would scrape powerschool for the letter day daily and display it in binary on the traffic light.
